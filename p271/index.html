<h3 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER 1</h3>

<p>Once there was a fiddler. He kept on playing music.What music he played was pretty.Everyone loved the music he played. One day the fiddler played Row-Row-Row your boat.When the fiddler played Row-Row-Row your boat the people started singing:â€Row-Row-your boat gently down the stream! Merrily Merrily Merrily life is but a dream!â€</p>

<p>They kept singing the song.After the fiddler started to playÂ LondonÂ bridges falling down.Â SubtlyÂ Some people started yelling,â€We donâ€™t like this song!Play Row-Row-Row your boat! please! pleaseâ€ By hearing this he stopped what song he was playing and started playing Row-Row-Row your boat.TheÂ peopleÂ stopped yelling and quietlyÂ listened.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</h3>

<p>THE WARÂ CausallyÂ the war started.The fiddler asked the people if he could play sad music when the people were fighting but the people said no because they thought that the fiddlerâ€™s fiddle will getÂ ruined.</p>
