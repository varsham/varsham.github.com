	<p>Had the French Revolution not occurred, many important changes would not have been made to the general state of France. Although it involved the brutal murder of hundreds of nobles, the reason being their unfortunate aristocratic name, it also broke down feudalism, which had plagued the country for many centuries. In fact, the massacre of the aristocrats was because of feudalism: The people who were further down the deadly feudalism ladder were not obliged to continue being forced to labor for the &ldquo;aristos&rdquo;. In fact, the aristocrats, which included the king and the queen, the nobles, and the knights - to some extent - were not required to pay taxes. On the other hand, the serfs and the peasants, which were the lowest castes of people in the feudal system, were demanded outrageous taxes that depleted them to such a degree that they constantly teetered on the brink of starvation. At last, it became widely of the opinion of the commons that a revolt against the aristocrats had to occur. It was the first step to a long and brutal journey that we now call the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Once the Revolution had begun, the guillotine was built to serve as a quicker method to the widespread bloody execution of the aristocrats, and many people who had once been a restrained and lowly part of the feudal system came to the Palace de Greve, the main area where the homicide took place, to watch the aristos get the revenge that the poor people felt they deserved. The aristocrats had begun to dress themselves in rags similar to the bloodthirsty commons, trying various disguises to leave the country that had suddenly turned from a luxurious haven to a dark place where they were suddenly unwelcomed. Unfortunately, many of the desperate aristocrats were weeded out, only to be carted to the guillotine to be killed. However, many people who had not directly contributed to the meager living conditions of the commons were killed by the guillotine because of their cursed aristo name. Furthermore, it is never ethical to take a person&rsquo;s life, no matter the circumstances. Therefore, the reasons behind the French Revolution were wholly morally unjust, despite the changes the Revolution had made to our society.</p>
