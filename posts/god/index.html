	<p>My roots take me back to India.
The air is musty, the roads are khaki-brown as my skin. Far off into the distance, I hear a devoted cry, a chant honoring God.</p>

<p>God is ingrained in India&rsquo;s culture; He is a source of hope among despair, and a ray of sunshine-yellow among the pitch-black dark, at least, for many. But what has he done for me?
Most importantly, what has he done for my family?</p>

<p>My aunt now huddles in bed under a skimpy blanket, a dry cough racking her feverish body. She waits as the agonizing hours go by, waiting for her son to come home, knowing all too well that she cannot fulfill his big dreams. What has God done for them?</p>

<p>Along the sides of the dusty roads of India are people, they faces and hand caked with dust, their dark hair whitened by the hours of sitting by the roads, hoping for a coin or two. They are stooped with poverty, not too different from the grassy boulivards in Maryland, where I often see people with their wayward children, holding up pitiful signs, their faces hopeful. What has God done for them?</p>

<p>I do not believe in God, but in the people around me, like my father.</p>

<p>My father had grown up in India, a glowing miracle among broken dreams. His mother would work nonstop, sewing clothing tirelessly but not getting nearly enough rupees in return. Somehow, my father had realized that education was the way out. Somehow, my father knew that working hard was the key. It was not God who brought him to a successful life in the United States, but it was my father&rsquo;s own willpower and unestimable courage.</p>

<p>I believe that although God may be a source of hope for some, the people themselves truly make their own dreams and wishes come true, like my inspiring father.</p>
