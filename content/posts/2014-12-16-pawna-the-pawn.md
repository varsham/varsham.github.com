title: Pawna the Pawn

I am the pawn. A girl pawn, to be specific. My name is Pawna. We always do this thing called chess. The queen says it is a game, but I donâ€™t think it is. I donâ€™t like it, mainly because I and the other pawns are always in the front row! I tried talking Bishop into switching spaces with me, but he never fell for it.

â€œPawna!â€ Itâ€™s the queen.

â€œAt your service queen!â€

â€œPawna dear, itâ€™s time for chess!â€

I am much deflated. But I canâ€™t disobey the queen, so I march out to my square.

Standing as high as I can, I can see my mother. She is one of the pawns in my rank. She has been through many battles, wins and losses. She is waving to me, wearing her biggest and prettiest smile. We sometimes are next to each other. Other times, she is far away from me. She looks exactly like me.Â As a matter of fact, all of us pawns look very much alike.

Finally, the whistle blows for the game to start. The queen catches my attention and signals for me to go first. I shuffle 2 spaces forward. A black pawn moves diagonal from me.

â€œBlack will destroy your flimsy self.â€ He snarles.

As pawns are allowed to do so, I knock the black pawn out. The black team gasped, as if that pawn is their only defense. But it isnâ€™t. Even if I wish it was. A black knight moves forward. He grits his teeth.

â€œYou think youâ€™re powerful? Not anymore!â€ he says, snickering.

I wish I could move backwards, but in the rules of pawn, it is a rule that pawns are strictly restricted from moving backwards. My queen realizes my fear and steps forward, scaring the knight. The knight moves farther away from the queen. My queen then lands right in front of a black pawn. The knight tries to find a way to get my queen out, but nothing works, so the knight moves closer to the queen instead. My queen uses a very smart way to dodge the defenders and break +-through many layers of black fighters. Finally, turn after turn, my queen blocks the king from going anywhere. White wins! I am relieved, but not for long.

We are tossed into a bag.The bag is packed into a dark box, until the next chess game.
