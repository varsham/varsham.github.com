The demons wanted to make possible an evil plan to cause destruction to the mortals, for they wanted Vishnu, the protector of the universe, to beg for pity. They wanted to show that they were stronger. They were so tired of losing against Vishnu. For the first time they wanted to win, because Vishnu was their archenemy. During the debate of what they should do, one demon suggested putting a layer of rocks on all of the skies of Earth so that living things down on Earth could not breathe. All the other demons immediately agreed. So they went down to Earth to finish the hard job of covering the skies with big, heavy, boulders. Â After a long time, the demons at last had finished. When they were finished, the demon king warned them not to tell Vishnu for he didnâ€™t want to face the wrath of Vishnu and the other gods. Therefore, all of the gods did not know of the troubles that lay ahead.

Garuda, Vishnuâ€™s vehicle, was feeling restless. He wanted to stretch out his large eagle wings and fly around a little bit down on Earth. So he flew down in the direction of Earth. But he did not see the glorious Earth appear before his eyes. He only saw a wall of large boulders. So he made a hole in the wall with his strong beak so he could get through. When he had flew through the hole, a strange sight met his eyes. People clutching their hands weakly around their throats as if they couldnâ€™t breathe. Animals lay still against dead grass. The trees were withering. Worried, Garuda hurried up to the heavens to tell the gods of what he had seen.

Garuda went through the heavens, shouting as he passed,â€I saw that all of the life on Earth were dying!â€ He kept shouting this until he reached Vishnu. Only then he put those large wings to rest. Garuda said,â€I saw that all of the life on Earth were dying!â€ Vishnu listened to Garuda calmly and said:â€Garuda, that is a strange sight you saw! Did you see anything else on your way there?â€

Garuda searched his memory of his journey. At last he remembered:â€I did see a wall, though and I had to poke my beak through itâ€¦..and then I saw people that were dying. They were clutching their throats as if they couldnâ€™t breathe!â€

By this time all of the gods were watching and waiting for Vishnu to say something.

Vishnuâ€™s serene face turned red with anger. His eyes started spitting fire. â€This simply has to be work of the demons! How dare the demon king try and hurt the mortals! What did they do to harm them?â€

After a long silence, Vishnuâ€™s face was troubled, but slowly, a smile crept across his face.

â€œWhat are you thinking, Vishnu?â€ asked Brahma, the creator of the universe.

â€œI have thought of a plan, Brahma,â€ replied Vishnu with a twinkle in his eyes. Then he turned to Garuda and said, â€I hope you havenâ€™t been flapping your wings so much that you are tired to go and call Vayu, the storm god?â€

Garuda then smiled. He started off again in a fast galloping pace that startled the gods as he sped past them.

When Garuda was gone, Vishnu asked Indra,â€I need the thunderbolt that you use in the wars against the demons. I will tell you why I need it: As you know, Garuda has seen a wall covering the skies. I was thinking of Vayu, the storm god to knock down that wall so that the mortals can breathe again.When Vayu creates a storm to tear down the rocks on the wall, you can destroy as many rocks as you can with your thunderbolt. But you must hurry because the mortals are dying. â€ Â Indra quickly pulled out his thunderbolt.

Just then, Garuda came back with Vayu. Nervous and excited, the gods watched as Vishnu carefully explained his plan to Vayu. Then Vishnu turned to Garuda and said,â€Take Vayu and Indra to the wall that you saw.â€

Garuda raised himself in the air, going to the wall this time. Vayu and Indra quickly followed Garuda. They saw the wall that had been causing trouble. Vayu was nervous. How would he be able to defeat this huge wall? Then, as Vishnuâ€™s serene voice rung in his ears, Vayu felt stronger again. He blasted the wall with the storms. Indra began destroying all that he could of the boulders that fell. Garuda helped break up the gigantic rocks with his beak.

The people suddenly felt gusts of air. They took deep breaths at last. The animals were finally revived, and the trees were slowly looking greener and greener by minute. When the people looked up, they saw millions of rocks fall down. After all the rocks had fallen down, the people went to ask a sage what had just happened. They knew that sages were connecting to gods in some way. The sage then admitted that he did not know what this amazing natural occurrence was, so he told the people to call it a meteor shower.

To this day, the demons still try to cover the skies with boulders, but they always fail. Â When the demons tried to do that evil deed again, Garuda would quickly inform Vayu and Indra to knock down the wall.
