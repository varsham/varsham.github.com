      <description>My roots take me back to India. The air is musty, the roads are khaki-brown as my skin. Far off into the distance, I hear a devoted cry, a chant honoring God.
God is ingrained in India&amp;rsquo;s culture; He is a source of hope among despair, and a ray of sunshine-yellow among the pitch-black dark, at least, for many. But what has he done for me? Most importantly, what has he done for my family?</description>

      <title>The French Revolution</title>

      <description>Had the French Revolution not occurred, many important changes would not have been made to the general state of France. Although it involved the brutal murder of hundreds of nobles, the reason being their unfortunate aristocratic name, it also broke down feudalism, which had plagued the country for many centuries. In fact, the massacre of the aristocrats was because of feudalism: The people who were further down the deadly feudalism ladder were not obliged to continue being forced to labor for the &amp;ldquo;aristos&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 1 - SOPHIE
The interviewees, Sophie, Theresa, Roy, and Kathryn, sat nervously at the wooden table, their trembling hands laced tightly together. Sophie was tapping her foot twice as fast as the seconds on the clock on the wall across from her, and the others watched her in silence. Suddenly, a man appeared out of the glass doorway across from them.
All four of them sat in the same room, the room with one glass window that was too tall to see from, and reflected all the light in the room.</description>

      <title>What was the Transatlantic Slave Trade?</title>

      <description>Well, what is it? The Transatlantic slave trade occurred during the 15th century, around 1650. What do you think when you hear the word &amp;ldquo;slave &amp;ldquo;?
You might be thinking of deadly diseases, forced labor, and just brutal conditions in general. This was all true for the slaves who were forced to work during the Transatlantic slave trade, but the Africans, the people who actually started the trade, did not mean for it to turn out that way.</description>

      <description>**CHAPTER 1: **
Kai grabbed a string of water from her desk and hung it up in her room. Her wings ruffled her chair, and strands of water fell off of it, turning to puddles on the floor.
&amp;ldquo;No! &amp;rdquo; cried Kai, as she gathered up the strands, quickly turning them into ropes of water again with a flick of her wrist. Her curtains, made of water, flickered, almost falling and suffering the same fate as the water ropes, but Kai dropped the strands and fixes them.</description>

      <description>My grandfather had cancer, and he was at the last stage of it. The doctors could do nothing for him now. On the way to the hospital, to have one last time to see him, in my hand were several photographs, of an iris flower, one of his favorites, and his favorite bird - the Chestnut-sided Warbler. He told me that he had only seen it once, and that day had been the greatest day of his life.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Back then, 50 years ago, people used things called &amp;#8216;computers&amp;rsquo; to search things up..blah, blah, blah &amp;hellip;Scarlett! &amp;ldquo;
I look up at my red-faced teacher, suddenly awoken out of my stupor, and mutter, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Scarlett Rose. &amp;ldquo;
&amp;ldquo;What did you say?! &amp;ldquo;
&amp;ldquo;I said it&amp;rsquo;s Scarlett Rose. &amp;ldquo;
My teacher finds nothing else to blame for, so, still red-faced, she goes back to her lesson. &amp;ldquo;They also used &amp;#8216;electricity&amp;rsquo; for light &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;</description>

      <description>MERILEE MAXWELL
Prologue
I finger the child&amp;rsquo;s hair, and she looks up at me, all bundled up in those blankets her parents gave her, her eyes red with baby tears. They&amp;rsquo;ll be waiting for their precious Araceli, I know. They will be waiting.
I lean backward, peering out of the sterile white door, and I catch a glimpse of _them: _ Xander and Rylee. Rylee&amp;rsquo;s hair is a mess of wispy brown flyaway, and she is clutching Xander&amp;rsquo;s hand, and grinning like an idiot.</description>

      <description>Crack! I hear the crack of the whip from outside, and my mother storms in, her face as red as the bricks on our fireplace. I know to avoid her at times like this, and I dodge the storming feet and the flailing hands, and especially, the whip. I run outside to our beautiful mansion, with a temptation to stop by the endearing little pond next to the mansion, but I resist it with a little regret, because I had many chores to do.</description>

      <description>I am a creative and music-loving girl
I feel excited about possibilities everywhere.
I dream that I&amp;rsquo;ve built a solution to a persistent problem,
and I pretend that these imagined creations could materialize before me,
and I hope that I can make a good impact on the world.
I am a creative and music-loving girl.
When I go outside, I see the families of birds twittering excitedly in their nests,</description>

      <description>The rich deep blue
is a masterpiece.
As if an artist is weaving a large brush over his endless canvas.
Or the sunset yellows, or bright orange,
whichever the artist chooses
is shown to all of Earth at different times.
The darker night
dotting the bluish-black sky
with the delicacy of stars
lighting up the night.
Whichever the artist chooses,
it is a masterpiece.
Whether it is the rising sun penetrating the once dark blue</description>

      <description>Everyone loved Robert, who could play the flute so beautifully and make his fingers fly and his legs dance, and Robert’s twin sister Darlene always welcomed the children that would drift towards his house to hear him play. He was the brightest silver lining our town ever had.
Robert was a friend of my mother, ever since we had moved here. He had cheered me up with his songs when I was sad, and he made Katie’s and my life as sweet as chocolate.</description>

      <description>Rough Draft – “Clinton and Trump”
My question about this article is about the subtitle “Trump Wants Stricter Rules”. My confusion about these paragraphs is about the temporary ban of Muslims entering the United States. How will temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country help with solving the problem? I say this because members of a violent Islamic group could already be in the United States, disguised. Another reason is that the article says two things about Muslims fleeing from this Islamic group that prove my point: “Many Muslims are trying to escape the violent group, though.</description>

      <description>The Adventures of Edward Tulane is an awesome book. I think this because of the author&amp;rsquo;s way of moving through the plot- not too fast and not too slow. I also loved the feelings the author put between the lines.
Summary: Edward Tulane was a china rabbit that was owned by a ten year old girl named Abilene. She loved him very much, but the rabbit didn&amp;rsquo;t love her as much as she did.</description>

Dear Little Brother/Sister, (Note: I don’t have a little brother or sister)
You’ve asked me over and over again what a budget is. Well, now I’m here to tell you. First of all, what is a budget? A budget is something that you create that you can use to plan out how you will spend your money. For example, consider that puzzle you’ve always wanted. But you have to consider that you need to get a certain reading book for school.</description>

      <description>I have a pet frog that has amazing acuity. The frog zeroes in on one of its &amp;ldquo;prey &amp;ldquo;(frog food) and waits until it thinks that the food won&amp;rsquo;t be alert when it catches it. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where my little frog came from, but I like to imagine that during the &amp;ldquo;Age of Immigration &amp;rdquo; a group of immigrants came and had the frog with them. The frog had escaped to the pet shop, and here I am, watching my frog&amp;rsquo;s acuity catch prey.</description>

      <description>Two notorious wildfires had raged through the USA. The earliest of these wildfires occurred in June, 1988. That fateful proved to be a very terrible day for everyone at that time. Three years later, in October, 1991, another wildfire erupted in Oakland, California. This day also proved to be terrible.
In Wyoming, Yellowstone park officials were suffering many firs. But none of the fires were major. Even so, firefighters were sent out to battle every blaze.</description>

      <description>Hi. I’m Sediment. I used to sit for a long time on this big tall pointy thing. My brothers and sisters have been cruelly taken by…Wind! I’ve been tossed around a lot by him, and believe me, you would NOT like it. It’s like being in those flying things that go around in the air all the time, except you are being roughhoused. Right now I am relaxing on a bunch of other sediment people.</description>

      <description>The seed grows,
The green sprouts emerge from the earth
Like reluctant school children
On a first day of school
But when the thunder strikes
The lightning illuminates the silent night
Terrible rains pour down
Like children swarming out at their recess time
But the sprouts stay
Leaves slowly grow
Their color bright green
With the radiance of a freshly painted piece of art.
The sprouts grow
into a small tree</description>

      <description>Hello.
My name is Mary Fieldson.
I’m 9, and I’m in 4th grade.
I have 3 brothers. Their names are: Daniel, Tyler, and Jacob. My dad used to work from some really early time to some really late time, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really see him often. My mother was the one who convinced my dad to take a new job and move to Florida. She grew up in Florida. She really enjoys the warm weather.</description>

      <title>Unhealthy School Lunches: What do you think?</title>

      <description>I think that unhealthy school lunches should not be allowed because they can cause diabetes. This disease does not have cure and it is developed by obesity. Obesity is developed from the eating of fried or oily foods, such as the foods in Haley&amp;rsquo;s cafeteria. Haley is a person who has a cafeteria that serves unhealthy lunches. According to the article I read, Haley&amp;rsquo;s lunch menu for that day was french fries, hot dogs, and pizza.</description>

      <description>Summer of the Swans is a book with very happy ending. I loved this book because when the second-most main character got lost in the woods, the tension of panic rose.
Summary:After Sara had taken Charlie, her mentally handicapped brother, to see the swans nearby, he fell in love with them. During the night, he was itching to go to the swans but he did not know the way, so he got lost.</description>

Her father had built her the house she lived in currently before he collapsed on his deathbed and died. Weeks after the house was built, people looking for places to build their houses got attracted to the little house and built their houses right there.</description>

      <description>The demons wanted to make possible an evil plan to cause destruction to the mortals, for they wanted Vishnu, the protector of the universe, to beg for pity. They wanted to show that they were stronger. They were so tired of losing against Vishnu. For the first time they wanted to win, because Vishnu was their archenemy. During the debate of what they should do, one demon suggested putting a layer of rocks on all of the skies of Earth so that living things down on Earth could not breathe.</description>

      <description>First, one defense is the skin. It keeps the germs from attacking the body organs. There is one way that germs can pass through the skin: If there is an open cut in the skin, the germs have a way to the body and making you sick.
Earwax is the 2nd body defense. It is in everyone&amp;rsquo;s ears to trap the germs who try to get the ear, trying to damage the delicate organs in the ear.</description>

When Columbus and future explorers traded items with the Americas that lived in the Americas, this was called the Columbian Exchange.</description>

      <description>I will be introducing you to the topic: eyelashes!!! Focus Question: What is the whole purpose of eyelashes? Answer: Eyelashes direct the flow of air out of your eyes. To clarify what I mean by that, eyelashes help keep your eyes moist, or slightly damp. Did you know that 22 species of animals rely on their eyelashes for the same reason? Bet you didn&amp;rsquo;t! From humans to horses to elephants, they all have the same reason the rely on their eyelashes!</description>

How Hurricanes Are Named
Hurricanes come to us in various different ways. Because of these changes, they get different names. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me how meteorologists detect the similarity, but they do! First, when a hurricane comes in, they name the hurricane. Boy names and girl names alternate, going back and forth into a pattern.</description>

Sugar Mae Cole had a father that she didn&amp;rsquo;t trust. He owed many people, including her grandfather, King Cole. But trouble flares after his death. 12-year-old Sugar Cole loses her home, and her mother shuts down, and Sugar&amp;rsquo;s dreary result was that she was left alone, and she had much to experience.</description>

      <description>When I hold my oboe
I feel a ripple of satisfaction
Slowly creeping its way up
When I purse my lips
I blow hopefully
And a cool, clear sound blasts out
creating a second ripple of satisfaction
I struggle
But that is key to satisfaction
That is how one learns.</description>

      <description>There are many
who cross the line
and once they do
they never come back
Tis&amp;rsquo; the line of good and bad
When one becomes bad
They never become good
When you cross that line
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist
You have no meaning
Your heart becomes rocky
Never feeling any touch of love
Unless you change
Until your soul forgives you.</description>

      <description>The snow falls
like angels from heaven
Soft and dainty
Falling on the grass
Which was once green
Until spring comes
The snow melts away
showing the grass once again
With that full green color
Finally it&amp;rsquo;s summer
The vapor greets us
Beads of sweat drip down our backs
Slapping away mosquitos
In summer, the stores with the repellent
Are in low supply
School&amp;rsquo;s out
Finally it&amp;rsquo;s fall
School starts again</description>

We would be seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a story which I have read for hours for my passion for it was strong. I used to read it so many times, although it was quite a large book.
Finally, I steeped out of the car, releived for the ride seemed to take long.</description>

      <description>Amelia Earhart, a rising female flier, is taking lessons from Neta Snook, a renowned flier. When Neta Snook first laid her eyes on the white-gloved lady, she thought, “More silly people with silly questions.” However, she soon realized that Amelia only wanted Neta to instruct her in the field of flying. Amelia started taking lessons with Neta beginning on the third of January, 1921.
On the first lesson, Amelia arrives wearing khaki pants, boots, a colorful scarf, and a knee length jacket which she has slept in for several nights to give it a used look.</description>

      <description>The dot grows
The green sprouts emerge from the earth
like reluctant school children
But when the thunder strikes
The lightening lights up the stilled night
Rains pour down
Like constant floods
But the sprouts stay
The sprouts grow
into a small tree
like the broccoli that we eat
But then the large winds blow
The tree falters
But it still stands strong
The roots grow
expanding wider
each week</description>

A worry line
creased Grandpa&amp;rsquo;s weary face
when he left Alexis to her fate
The one who stayed by his side
For all the years to come,
he hoped that she would face it
ALEXIS
I hope
Grandpa&amp;rsquo;ll be all right
Since Denise died
I could not face it
Why me?
Denise
She was so kind
She suffered my pain with me
Until her end

Her father had built the little house she lived in, and this drew attention to the ones living in the hotels to live in houses of your own.</description>

      <description>My home. Denmark. A village of beauty. The sky always had that forget-me-not blue in the mornings. The sun glowed bright yellow. In the night-times, there was a beautiful blackish bluish color in the dark sky. The stars twinkled like far away lanterns, and the moon glowed a gray color, filled with sweetness of no other kind. In the mornings, the morning dew sparkled on the bright green grass. A young tree in front our house had birds chirping all over it in their nests.</description>

      <description>The little girl was a baby when they left. Her parents had been on a trip. They never came back, even when seven years passed. Every year, Helena had asked Anna, her old housekeeper when her parents would be coming back, and Anna always answered they would always come back.
But that stopped when Anna passed away three years ago.
Since she was 7 years old, Helena was left to live with her horrid uncle.</description>

If I was a superhero, I would want to be able to conjure up anything that I want. I would want to have this ability because then, it would be easy for me to save many lives. Another power I would like is the ability to time travel to any place I want. I would want this power because if I time traveled back to the Revolutionary War, I could save many people from dying.</description>

      <description>She escaped from Salem
Ever since her mother was a witch to them
She never believed in them
But they did
The people of Salem
She was afraid
She was inconsolable
for she had loved her mother
more than the world itself
She was sad and alone
An orphan
She dreamt
in her lonely fort
that she could stop
the dangerous people of Salem
Starting at her youth
To stop the superstitious people</description>

My mother makes hot chocolate
I sip it

C turned a certain angle you can slide on,
D is a house

F always
Tries to be like E
But she is almost there
G is a gymnast
so flexible
H a comfy bed
That children go to at

      <description>I live in the suburbs. Whenever I go outside, I hear the deep barking of dogs. In the evenings, it smells like after a bonfire. On my section of the street, there are the perfect hiding places, so Hide and Go Seek is a popular game in my circle of friends. There are lots of trees fit for climbing, and in one of my friend&amp;rsquo;s backyard, there were 2 swings. They took 1 of the swings down, because the trees was rotting where it hung.</description>

      <description>India is now but a distant memory in my mind, a haze of khaki dusty roads, a slight ray of warmth, the burn of delicious spices in my mouth, the sandy heat of my feet on the sun-warmed rooftops. I remember the jasmine tree outside of my aunt&amp;rsquo;s house, the delicate flowers sweet-smelling and vibrant white against the rich dark green of the tree, and I remember biting into a soft, ripe mango, the juice dribbling down my chin as the rich sweetness dissolves on the tip of my tongue.</description>

      <description>British and America
declared war,
on 1775
one day before
April&amp;rsquo;s 20th
That&amp;rsquo;s when the guns raised
Independence
was a great struggle
when each took their side,
Soldiers were enlisted
from everyplace
Just to protect the country
All with different names
one great leader
that lead America
by the great name of George
Washington led his group
all the way in Valley Forge
The soldiers felt like wrangling
talked spiteful things behind his back</description>

      <description>Rhodopus had went on a trip to some sort of mystic cliffs and mountains and, quite accidentally, was hanging off a very strong cliff rock. Her cold hands gripped the bumps and the holes that were formed inside the rock very long ago.
She was so frightened that she thought that she would have rather fell and died rather than keep gripping onto that rock.
Well, reader, you might be asking why she was hanging of a rock.</description>

But I did know
Father
Just grabbing his suitcase
Out the door
To the world
Where I could never find him
I looked at Mother
A tear rolling down her cheek
I could tell
It was a tear of sadness mixed with anger
I ran upstairs
Sobs bursting out
Years passed
A ring from the doorbell
We&amp;rsquo;ve haven&amp;rsquo;t had one in ages
I opened the door</description>

      <description>WHAT IS EMPATHY?
Empathy is everything to everyone. Even the evil. Empathy is like the desired gold to humans. But not many people have empathy.
Empathy is a certain type of kindness. It is but a special type of kindness. There is also this kindness called sympathy. Being sympathetic is easier to be than empathetic. But let me explain about sympathy. Sympathy is when you are sorry for a person. Empathy is when you feel sorry for a person and you do something out of kindness for them.</description>

      <description>I am the pawn. A girl pawn, to be specific. My name is Pawna. We always do this thing called chess. The queen says it is a game, but I don’t think it is. I don’t like it, mainly because I and the other pawns are always in the front row! I tried talking Bishop into switching spaces with me, but he never fell for it.
“Pawna!” It’s the queen.</description>

      <description>I was a spring girl. I control the weather in spring. Mother was the controller of fall, my father was the controller of spring and winter. That is why father was dull when he was sad, to resemble his winter powers, and he was extremely excited when he was happy, to resemble his spring powers. Mother was like any human mother, because fall is in the middle of hot and cold.</description>

      <description>There once lived 2 girls in a village. Both of them thought that no one else was their age in that dreary place. Their mothers made them wash the clothes and do other tedious things, so they never got a chance to explore anything. Elaine was one of the girls, and was finally bored of her chores. To activate her plan, she sneaked out of the washing parlor and ran off.</description>

      <description>I am an orphan. I&amp;rsquo;d rather be alone than be adopted. This is my story. For the beginning, I was adopted. I was 8 years old. I always dreamed of doing ridiculous things. I was a dreamer. Adventurous. I cried on the the first day I lived with my mother and father. I always curled up into a ball and slept in my room. When it was my 9th birthday, I got the courage to say something very sad.</description>

It ought to be a shame
that it comes every year
there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to fear
on Old&amp;rsquo;Hallows&amp;rsquo;Eve
Ghosts, Princess&amp;rsquo;s
so many dresses
to Wear
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to glare
on Halloween
&amp;#8216;Cause you stuff your mouth with sweets
You never have to eat meats
&amp;#8216;Cause all you need
and all you feed
on are sweets!

      <description>The little girl ran breathlessly through the spring air, feeling fresh. Her land, Leafland, was always like that. “March, calm down!” said her father as she almost knocked him over. Her name was March, and she had a shiny white smile with her. 10 year old March collected leaves for her grandfather’s leaf necklace studio and crept up silently to his door.She then burst open with her shiny white smile. After a bit of laughter, March’s Grandfather went to work.</description>

I always secretly hope that we can defeat them soon. But that will never happen. I had sweat all over my face at the end of class because I was thinking so hard about this. On the way home, I accidently bumped into a gladiator. My big mistake.</description>

I climbed out of bed, then I picked up the dolphin, then shrunk, then climbed inside. I climbed through the hole at the bottom. That was when I realized that the crack was closed! I tried to rub around where the crack was and I pushed that part, but nothing budged!</description>

Finally, the black thing went away from the crack.</description>

It was so eerie. suddenly, the grass grew up and up until it towered over me. I slipped inside the hole at the bottom of the dolphin. I was almost fully inside until my mom picked it up. I grew frantic. I did not get enough time! I clung desperately to the edge of the hole.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anna was up the tree, she heard Caroline saying, &amp;ldquo;Spin three times to go to your adventure. &amp;rdquo; Anna spun three times and in a long time (She is in a whirlwind and it takes long time). Anna read the sign, SNOW-ATOM ADVENTURE FOR ICE! . Anna ran along and saw some Ice Controls. She made a mountain which broke them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then came across a monster. It said, &amp;ldquo;I am Marmalade! I love ice fairies! &amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are Heat? &amp;rdquo; asked Anna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, &amp;rdquo; answered Marmalade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna made an ice sheet and shot it to Marmalade. When the ice quickly melted, Marmalade died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna was surprised to see some more Ice Controls. Again, she made a mountain to destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, she cried,  &amp;ldquo;I want to go back to Fairyland! I wish I could! &amp;rdquo; In a whirl wind, Anna was laying on a bed of leaves. She woke up to find her friend Caroline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are safe from your adventure. Always remember your adventures with Marmalade. You are so brave! I am proud of you! &amp;rdquo; said Caroline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Oh the Kangaroo Club!
The jump roping Club,
I jumped as long as a 4th grader,
That is just the small facts so let me tell you a story.
I did not think I COULD do it,
But as my heart pounded and thudded and worked,
I just started to take it easy.
One stopped at the 2nd grade point,
While I JUMPED AND JUMPED so long that my chest started arguing with me,</description>

Both entering our mischievous ways,

      <description>Colors, the wonderful,
Oh! Blue and gray, colors of sea,
Little girl enjoys those vast colors,
Oh! The earth is a colorful land,
All Red? No!
Everything is a different color,
So bright to make you smile.
Pink is life,
I love pink,
No pink, So much sadness,
Kept at the darkest color.
Blue the bright,
Living to be brilliant,
Up we go, to the brilliant blue sky,
EEK! Blue the beautiful.</description>

      <description>One day, little Cassie walked across the pasture. The grass sparkled with the light of the Sun. The trees were entirely covered with blossoms. To Cassie, it felt like a dream. Cassie walked everyday, until she wanted color to the grass. Cassie would trade anything for colored grass. Suddenly an idea sprang up in her mind. She got her paint brushes and paints. Cassie painted the grasses like stripes of colors.</description>

Seawater Beach was beautiful because the waves gently walked along its mushy border -the sand. Alissa, her mother and their dog Buttercup went along the beautiful beach. Alissa decided to make sand castles. Before they could make a sand castle, the waves suddenly rocked ferociously across it&amp;rsquo;s border.
Alissa&amp;rsquo;s dog Buttercup helplessly barked at the long, high, strides of desperate waves. Buttercup yanked the leash out of Alissa&amp;rsquo;s hands and disappeared into the waves.</description>

When I always not sooth
When I waste a lot of food
in my grumpy mood
I always like to play
and that&amp;rsquo;s what I say
everyday.
My mom gives me math
My mom gives reading
and I never do seeding
I improve every time
I should give lime
and I help my mom
everytime when I can</description>

      <description>I grunt, I cry. There cannot be any solution. Could there just be one? There could if I stopped, there could if I stopped all unintelligible talks with comforting parents. Could I just show that I would stop? This should be comforting if i’d stop. Parents should not here small peels(cries) from me. Should I be positive or negative? POSITIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Parents love their sons or daughters if there is a lot of cooperation.</description>

      <description>One day there was a sailor, who lived far away, in the land of Tanzeen. He mostly went on a boat called Seaville. The ocean he went was called The Everest Sea. His name was Collin Major. His family was very poor. He tried to sell Everest Sea’s fish, but all he caught was stinky fish. Collin knew he had to help him and his sea friends to get a lot of money.</description>

      <description>I always want to improve when I always not sooth when I waste a lot of food in my very grumpy mood
I always like to play and that&amp;rsquo;s what I say everyday.
My mom gives me math, My mom gives me reading and I never do seeding
I improve every time I should give lime and I help my mom when ever I can.</description>

      <description>I woke up, groggy, muscles aching. I could not remember how I got to where I was: A dark, small, room, with a padlocked door across from me. The air is musty, and smells of cow manure. My wrists throb, and I look down to see a dark purplish-blue bruise blossoming on the side of my left wrist. My heart begins to race as I slowly understand my situation.
I am trapped here.</description>
